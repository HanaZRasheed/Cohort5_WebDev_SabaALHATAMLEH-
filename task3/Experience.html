MedCart: Medication Cart
As a part of research project (23th October , team of 3) we worked
on a mobile application that provides a rich drug information by
conducting a database that contains the medicineâ€™s name, price,
usage and side effects and other drug details. The application
provides the ability to order the medicine from the intended
pharmacy and they will deliver it to any selected location. As
provides the accessibility of using the google maps system to go to
the nearest pharmacy.
